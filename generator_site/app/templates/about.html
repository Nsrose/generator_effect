				<div id="description">
					The generation effect is a phenomenon where information is better remembered if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply read. This effect is caused by the removal of a single letter from a word. This causes the mind to 'insert' the letter back into the word, which involves more cognitive processes and helps insure a more active reading experience; all of which allow for a deeper encoding of the text resulting in a much cleaner retrieval of read material.
					In other words, if you want to better remember a text, in a much more active form, remove letters randomly from the inside of words. 
					The program our team designed and implemented, removes letters from words of length greater than 5 from any text copy and pasted from any text document.
